About:
This is a Playlist API that allows users to add, edit, and sort playlists for all their music needs. It takes advantage of doubly linked lists and search and sort algorithms to ensure smooth user interactions with the API. To interact with this repository you will need to download and run postman to input data into the database and interact with the playlist. To learn more about inputting data with postman please refer to docs.txt.
